# Phi Approximater #

This approximates Phi using its relationship with the Fibonacci numbers, namelyt that the quotient of two consecutive terms (the larger being in the numerator) approaches the golden ratio as the terms grow.

Of course, you could also simply take the square root of five, add one, and divide the whole thing by two, but this is mainly just for my practice, and it's nice to see the terms grow.
