# Phi Approximater #

## Archived ##

This is an older project of mine from earlier in my coding career. I don't feel like making it private or deleting it, but this project does not necessarily reflect my current methodology as a developer. No further changes have been made. 

## About ##

This approximates Phi using its relationship with the Fibonacci numbers, namely that the quotient of two consecutive terms (the larger being in the numerator) approaches the golden ratio as the terms grow.

Of course, you could also simply take the square root of five, add one, and divide the whole thing by two, but this is mainly just for my practice, and it's nice to see the terms grow.

I do not plan on adding a CLI for this.
